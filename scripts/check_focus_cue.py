"""check_focus_cue.py — gate keyboard focus cues on elements a change touches.

A control a keyboard user can reach with Tab must show *something* when it holds
focus (WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible, Level AA). ``index.css`` is where that comes from
for free, via a global ``:focus-visible`` outline, so the way this breaks in
practice is an element opting out of the outline — ``outline-none``,
``focus:outline-none`` — and putting nothing in its place. Nothing else fails when
that happens: the element still works, and a pointer user never sees the
difference.

One thing to be honest about: that global rule is **commented out** in
``index.css`` as this gate lands (behind a ``TESTING: disabled to check scroll
bug`` note), and restoring it is a separate change. Until it is back, "inherit the
global outline" is not yet a working remedy, and this gate's value is narrower than
its end state: it stops NEW suppressors from reaching the trunk while the tree-wide
backlog — which that one disabled line created — is cleared separately. That is
what a diff-scoped gate is for, so the sequencing costs nothing; it just should not
be mistaken for delivering the cue.

## Why diff-scoped and not whole-tree

The rule reads an element's whole ``className``, so it is precise, but the tree
can still carry pre-existing holes and a whole-tree gate would charge them to
whoever pushed next. The enforcing check therefore reads only elements whose
``className`` (or opening tag) this change *touched* (``FOCUS_CUE_BASE_REF``),
which is complete for regression: a hole can only reach ``main`` through a diff
that wrote its className. The whole-tree number is still printed, as a
non-failing report, so the backlog stays visible without being a build break.

## What is exempt, and why

* An element Tab cannot land on — no natively focusable tag, no ``tabIndex={0}``,
  no ``onClick``, no ``role``.
* ``tabIndex={-1}``: a programmatic focus target (a route heading, a dialog
  shell). Focus is moved there by script to reposition a screen reader, so a
  ring would appear for a navigation the user did not perform.
* An element that supplies its own cue — any ``focus-visible:``/``focus:``
  utility that paints (ring, border, background, shadow, text), or the repo's
  ``focus-ring`` class.
* A ``role="combobox"`` input carrying ``aria-activedescendant``: focus stays in
  the field for the life of the surface while the arrow keys move a visible
  selection through the listbox, so the highlighted OPTION is the cue. A
  ``focus-visible`` utility on such a field never turns off, and draws a box or
  band no launcher UI has.
* An element whose cue is carried by a **descendant** through Tailwind's
  ``group`` mechanism: the element itself has the ``group`` marker class and a
  child has ``group-focus-visible:ring-2`` or similar. Such an element suppresses
  its own outline *correctly* — the child's ring is the replacement, and
  frequently the better one, since a slider knob's ring points at the current
  value where an outline round the whole track does not. Reading only the
  element's own ``className`` scores it as an uncued suppressor; acting on that
  report means deleting a correct ``outline-none`` and painting two focus
  indicators on one control, which is exactly what happened on the
  ``role="slider"`` track in ``components/ui.tsx`` before this exemption
  existed. Both halves are required: the marker alone is not a cue, and a
  ``group-*`` utility that is itself a suppressor is not a cue. ``peer`` is
  deliberately NOT recognised — the tree has zero ``peer-`` cues, so it would be
  a branch with no consumer; such an element uses the ``focus-cue-ok`` hatch
  until real usage exists.

``focus:outline-none`` is a *suppressor*, not a cue. Matching only the
``focus:outline`` prefix promotes it to a cue and hides the hole it creates,
which is why the self-test plants that exact case.

## Usage

    # enforce on the elements this branch touched (exit 1 on any violation)
    FOCUS_CUE_BASE_REF=origin/main python3 scripts/check_focus_cue.py

    # report the whole-tree backlog, enforce nothing (exit 0)
    python3 scripts/check_focus_cue.py

    # self-test: plant one probe per rule family, assert each verdict
    python3 scripts/check_focus_cue.py --test

## Escape hatch

An element whose cue this rule cannot see (one supplied by a parent, or by CSS
keyed on something other than a class) can opt out with a ``focus-cue-ok``
comment on the line the ``className`` starts. Use it sparingly, and say where
the real cue lives.
