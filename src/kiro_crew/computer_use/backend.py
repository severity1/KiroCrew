"""The computer-use backend seam: one ABC, one registry, one platform branch.

``ComputerUseBackend`` is what varies by OS; everything above it (policy,
rendering, the index lifecycle, the MCP dispatch) is platform-free. The seam is a
plain ``abc.ABC`` with a runtime-swappable factory — the shape
``embeddings.register_embedding_backend`` already uses — rather than a
``PlatformContext`` extension point, because CPP is the *edition* seam
(standalone vs companion) while computer use varies by *platform*, and because a
registry stays swappable inside a single pytest process.

Two structural guarantees:

* **One platform branch.** :func:`select_default_backend` is the only place in
  the whole package that asks which OS this is, and it asks
  ``platform_compat.IS_MACOS`` / ``IS_WINDOWS`` / ``IS_LINUX`` rather than
  reading ``sys.platform`` itself.
* **No exception crosses the seam.** Every method returns a
  :class:`DriverResult`; drivers convert their own failures into
  ``ok=False``. A ``ComputerUseError`` escaping into the MCP stdio loop's worker
  thread would take the tool call down, and an unhandled ctypes fault would take
  the sidecar with it.

Nothing in this module imports ctypes, and the native drivers are imported
lazily inside :func:`select_default_backend` — so importing this package on a
Linux CI runner loads no native library at all.

    * **Never raise.** Convert every failure — a missing app, an accessibility
      error, a permission denial — into ``DriverResult(ok=False, text=<reason>)``
      with the reason WITHOUT an ``Error: `` prefix (the dispatch layer adds it
      exactly once).
    * **Never move the pointer unless the request says to.** Every method is
      app-scoped by default: an element click is an accessibility action and a
      coordinate click/drag posts to the target process, so the operator's cursor
      does not move. The ONE exception is a :class:`ClickRequest` /
      :class:`DragRequest` whose ``moves_pointer`` is True (the ``global``
      method), which the model must have NAMED explicitly — ``auto`` never resolves
      to it. A driver MUST NOT warp the cursor for any other method, and MUST NOT
      silently upgrade a refused app-scoped click into a pointer-moving one.
    * **Set ``ElementRec.secure`` from BOTH ``AXRole`` and ``AXSubrole``** (or
      the platform equivalent). A password box reports an innocuous role with a
      secure *subrole* and a readable value; a role-only check misses every one.
      Every downstream protection — value redaction, input refusal, screenshot
      suppression — keys off this flag, so a driver that gets it wrong defeats
      all three at once.
    * **Set ``Snapshot.captured_at`` from ``time.monotonic()``**, never wall
      clock, so the TTL cannot be defeated by a clock adjustment.
    * **Be thread-safe.** The MCP loop dispatches on a worker thread while the
      main thread reads stdin.
