"""Shared hardened runner for the GitHub CLI (``gh``).

Single source of the gh TRUST POLICY — binary validation, resolution order,
and the child-environment key set — for every ``gh``-spawning surface: the
dashboard's PR sidebar (``dashboard/handlers/source_providers.py``), Issue
Radar (``apps/builtins/issue_radar/backend/github_client.py``), and Code
Review Sage (``apps/builtins/code_review_sage/sage_lib/discovery.py`` /
``pipeline.py``). Each previously carried its own copy of the hardened-runner
pattern, so a hardening fix had to land in three places and a missed copy
silently kept the weaker guard.

Spawning is shared for the sync app-side callers only: Issue Radar and Sage
route every spawn through :func:`run_gh` below, while the sidebar keeps its
own async, sandbox-routed, output-bounded spawn (``_run_json``) and consumes
only this module's validation/candidates/env-key policy. A spawn-level
hardening change must therefore land in ``run_gh`` AND ``_run_json`` — two
places, down from four, with the policy itself in one.

The shared pieces:

* **Trusted-binary resolution** — :func:`validate_provider_executable` and
  :func:`provider_executable_candidates` (the policy that refuses a binary
  owned by another user, a world-writable one, or one inside the
  agent-writable project/workspace tree), plus :func:`resolve_gh`, the
  caller-facing resolver with override-env and caching semantics.
* **Minimal child environment** — :func:`gh_env`, the one canonical
  passthrough list of gh-scoped auth/network/TLS variables on top of the
  platform's safe-key base. Ambient SSH-agent/git-ssh identity is stripped:
  ``gh api`` authenticates with its own token/config over HTTPS and has no
  business presenting the gateway's ssh identity.
* **The sync spawn chokepoint** — :func:`run_gh`, which enforces a validated
  absolute binary, the minimal env, a bounded timeout, and a SEL audit event
  on success, failure, and timeout for every sync app-side caller.
* **URL parsing** — :func:`parse_github_repo_url` and :class:`RepoUrlError`.

This module MUST NOT import ``kiro_crew.dashboard.*`` (at module scope or
lazily): it exists to dissolve that cross-layer dependency. Heavy runtime deps
(``kiro_crew.sel``, ``kiro_crew.apps.registry``, ``kiro_crew.config.loader``)
are imported lazily inside functions so Code Review Sage's standalone import
path (``sage_lib`` without the Kiro Crew runtime) keeps working for callers
that guard their import of this module.

    ``critical=True`` is the audit-or-deny half of the contract: the failure
    propagates so the caller can refuse the spawn (used for the pre-spawn
    ``invoked`` event — a gh call must never run unaudited). Outcome events
    are best-effort — the spawn already happened and its ``invoked`` record
    landed, so a failed outcome write is logged at warning, never silently.

    The operation name is namespaced from *caller* (``core:issue-radar`` →
    ``issue_radar.gh_run``) so each surface keeps its historical SEL operation
    identity while the emission point is shared.

    ``argv[0]`` must be the validated absolute path produced by
    :func:`resolve_gh` (or a caller wrapper over it) — a relative or bare name
    is refused so no call site can quietly regress to a PATH lookup. The child
    receives exactly :func:`gh_env` (minimal, gh-scoped — this is what keeps
    unrelated gateway secrets away from a substituted or compromised gh), a
    bounded *timeout*, and SEL audit events tagged with *audit_caller*
    (``core:issue-radar``, ``core:code-review-sage``, …): a fail-closed
    ``invoked`` event before the spawn (audit unavailable ⇒ the call is
    refused with :class:`SetupError`), then a best-effort outcome event on
    success, non-zero exit, timeout, and spawn ``OSError``. ``pin_host`` is forwarded to :func:`gh_env`
    for callers whose bare API paths never pass ``--hostname`` and must not
    drift to an ambient ``GH_HOST``.

    Error mapping is deliberately transparent: ``subprocess.TimeoutExpired``
    and ``FileNotFoundError`` are re-raised (after auditing) so each caller
    keeps its own error taxonomy, and a non-zero exit is returned as-is for
    the caller to classify.

    NOT sandbox-routed today: these sync callers historically spawned bare and
    this refactor is behavior-preserving. Strict-mode sandboxing would hide
    ``~/.config/gh`` + the keychain and break auth, though the sidebar's async
    path shows standard-mode routing is compatible — adopting it here is a
    follow-up, not a constraint. The trusted-binary requirement, minimal env,
